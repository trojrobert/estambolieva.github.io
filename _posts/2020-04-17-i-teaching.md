Here is my most recent tutoring experience:

* teaching assistant in programming for `Algorithms: Design and Analysis` by [Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) and Tim Roughgarden on Coursera


* teaching `programming and A.I.` to lawyers (the biggest Portuguese law firm [PLMJ](https://www.plmj.com/en/))

**Success**: The particinpatns were able to write code in 5 weeks, and understand the bits and bolts of simple machine learning algorithms by week 8.


* `recommended system workshop` at Lisbon.ai. Here is my paper for it [here](http://tiny.cc/kpa6mz), and the programme details [here](http://lisbon.ai/program.html#recommender).

**Success**: The participants all implemented a collaborative filtering system in less than 4 hours.


* teaching `python for data science` to freshly hired consultants at Marionete (https://marionete.co.uk/) - a London based Data Engineering consultancy firm.


* teaching assistant at `LxMLS` (Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School and their [guide](http://lxmls.it.pt/2019/LxMLS_guide_2019.pdf) for 2 years in a roll - mainly teaching first year PhD students.
